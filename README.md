# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 🧠

This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. It involves exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- Features: Glucose, Blood Pressure, Insulin, BMI, Age, etc.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data Cleaning and Null Handling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling and Transformation
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall)

## 📁 Files
- `Diabetes.ipynb`: Full notebook with EDA, modeling & results
- `README.md`: Project overview and details

## 📌 Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment with Streamlit
- Ensemble methods
